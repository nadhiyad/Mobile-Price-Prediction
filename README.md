### Mobile Price Prediction Project

>> This project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate mobile phone prices based on their features. By understanding the key attributes that influence pricing, the project helps a mobile phone retail organization refine its pricing strategy in a highly competitive market.

### Project Overview

The project involves the following key tasks:

**1. Data Exploration:** Load and explore a dataset containing detailed information on various mobile phones, such as model, color, memory, RAM, battery capacity, camera specifications, AI lens presence, height, processor, and price.

**2. Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables (e.g., model, color) into suitable numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding.

**3. Feature Extraction:** Use statistical methods and visualizations to identify the most relevant features that strongly affect mobile phone prices.

**4. Model Building for Mobile Price Prediction:**

**Linear Regression:** Develop a baseline model to predict prices using a linear approach.
**Decision Tree:** Build a model that uses a tree-based structure for making price predictions.
**Random Forest:** Create an ensemble model that improves prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
**Gradient Boosting:** Apply a more advanced ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to minimize prediction errors.
**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) to determine the most accurate model for price prediction.

**5. Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyze the importance of each feature derived from the models to confirm which features have the greatest impact on mobile phone prices.

**6. Dashboard Creation:** Create a dynamic dashboard in Tableau with multiple visualizations to display key insights and findings.

**7. Reporting and Visualization:** Compile a comprehensive report or presentation summarizing the project's findings, including insights on feature importance and their impact on price prediction.

**8. Deliverables**
>> A detailed project report or presentation covering the entire process from data exploration to model building.
>> All code and scripts used in data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
>> Visualizations and insights regarding feature importance and model performance.
>> Recommendations for the organization based on the project's findings.

**Tools and Libraries**
>> **Python:** For data preprocessing, analysis, and model building.

>> **scikit-learn:** For implementing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

>> **Tableau:** For creating dynamic data visualizations and dashboards.
